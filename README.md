# openscad-skf

A simple openscad file that contains definitions for SKF LLTHC U rails.
As simple as possible for my own needs, pretty much untested. 

Children to the skf_assembly() call will be positioned with the top center of the carriage as [0,0,0].
This also allows animations where the carriage moves with the load on top.
